 ├─ Modules
     ├─ AppController
	   ├─ BaseActivity (Common methods containing basic requirements of Activities resides here like checkInternetConnectivity,ShowToast)	 
     ├─ Constants (URLConstants resides here)
     └─ projectModule
                    ├─ controller (containing Activities,Buisness logic here)
			├─ TrueCallerAssignmentActivity (Activity used for the problem statement)
                    	├─ TrueCallerFactoryInterface 
			├─ TrueCallerAssignmentFactory (Factory class for determining class type) 
                    	├─ Find10thCharacter
			├─ Every10thCharacter
                    	├─ WordsCount						
                    ├─ models
                    	├─ listener (Callback listeners)
                    	├─ Asynctask (Used as a model for making network call)
				

Assignment Output 

1. Truecaller10thCharacterRequest: 
For this point, returned the 10th Character of the html response received which with given url returns html response as <!DOCTYPE  so 10th character output is a space character“ ”

2. TruecallerEvery10thCharacterRequest:
For this point, returned a StringBuilder with the html response received. 

3. TruecallerWordCounterRequest:
For this point, First creating a hashmap with index as words and its count in html as value and then build a StringBuilder from the hashmap and returned it back with the callback         


Other Best Practices Used ::

Used Factory design pattern to get data callback for separate TextViews. 
Factory determines which data structure to be used as per the problem statement and respond with the correct corresponding class which contains the data retrieval logic.
Advantages of using it :: Extensibility (Open-Closed Principle) , Unit-Testability, Reuse

All network related call has been made through background thread via usage of Async Task

Used styles, colors, dimen, strings.xml to make code clear and reusable.
